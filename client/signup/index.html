            <strong><p>Privacy</p></strong>
            <p>Privacy is one of our number one concerns at Mozilla Messaging, however as this is an alpha pre-release please keep in mind that there will be bugs, and security is still something which we will be refining.</p>

            <strong><p>Alpha capabilities</p></strong>
            <p>Raindrop is in its infancy right now. As of this moment we have been focussing on the reading experience within Raindrop - because of this it is currently at a read-only stage. Our goal is to change the way you read and sort your mail, not the way you write it. The most valuable feedback we can receive is on your reading experience, and of course once we have all the kinks worked out we will be implementing a fantastic composition tool. For more information on what we have planned check out the <a href="#">Raindrop milestone planning page</a>.</p>

            <div class="c1 info">
            <strong><p>Contributers</p></strong>
            <p>Our hosted alpha release is very small scale - small scale to the point that there are fewer than 20 people running a hosted version of Raindrop. We're hoping that the few we have selected to participate in this release will actively contribute by filing bugs and articulating constructive feedback. We know that Raindrop isn't perfect right now, but hopefully with early contributers like yourself we will be able to expediate the development process. Before filing a bug please take a look at the <a href="#">list of known issues</a>.</p>

            <div class="c1 info">
            <strong><p>Messages</p></strong>
            <p>Due to the cost of hosting Raindrop at this early stage we are only storing your past couple days worth of messages in an effort to keep things affordable. Of course this will change once we have everything worked out, but please bare with us for now.</p>
