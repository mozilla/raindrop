This is a holding area for various items in connections to running
raindrops in a hosted environment.

There is very little structure (or documentation) at this time, that
will come at a later time. In the meantime, direct and questions to
gozer@mozillamessaging.com, but, really, you probably shouldn't even
be looking at what's here at this time.
