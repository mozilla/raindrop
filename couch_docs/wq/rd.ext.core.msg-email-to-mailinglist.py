# This extension extracts information about a mailing list through which
# a message has been sent.  It creates rd.mailing-list docs for the mailing
# lists, one per list, and rd.msg.email.mailing-list docs for the emails,
# one per email sent through a list.  All the information about a list
# is stored in its rd.mailing-list doc; a rd.msg.email.mailing-list doc
# just links an email to its corresponding list.

# We extract mailing list info from RFC 2369 headers, which look like this:
#
#   Mailing-List: list raindrop-core@googlegroups.com;
#       contact raindrop-core+owner@googlegroups.com
#   List-Id: <raindrop-core.googlegroups.com>
#   List-Post: <mailto:raindrop-core@googlegroups.com>
#   List-Help: <mailto:raindrop-core+help@googlegroups.com>
#   List-Unsubscribe: <http://googlegroups.com/group/raindrop-core/subscribe>,
#       <mailto:raindrop-core+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com>

# Here's another example (with some other headers that may be relevant):

#   Archived-At: <http://www.w3.org/mid/49F0D9FC.6060103@w3.org>
#   Resent-From: public-webapps@w3.org
#   X-Mailing-List: <public-webapps@w3.org> archive/latest/3067
#   Sender: public-webapps-request@w3.org
#   Resent-Sender: public-webapps-request@w3.org
#   Precedence: list
#   List-Id: <public-webapps.w3.org>

#   List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:public-webapps-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe>

# This extension also handles most of the process of Raindrop-assisted list
# unsubscription.  Once a user has requested unsubscription via the Raindrop
# front-end, this extension fields the request from the mailing list to confirm
# the unsubscription.  Afterwards it fields the notification from the list
# that the user has been unsubscribed.

# There is no standard for these messages; we have to employ unique techniques
# for each mailing list server software.  For now we do this by hardcoding
# detectors for major servers; in the future there might be a way to abstract
# the detectors into a set of declarations (such that detectors can be simpler
# extensions of this extension) or to define a standard mechanism that we get
# mailing list software vendors to adopt.

# Currently, we support Raindrop-assisted list unsubscription for the following
# server software:
#   Google Groups version 1 (before around 2009 November/December)
#   Google Groups version 2 (after around 2009 November/December)
#     (Google Groups changed the format of its unsubscribe confirm requests
#      and unsubscription confirmations around 2009 November or December.
#      These version numbers are our arbitrary designation for the formats.)
#   Mailman

# Life cycle of Raindrop-assisted unsubscription:
#
# Initial State:
#   The mailing list status is "subscribed".
#
# Step 1: User Requests Unsubscription
#   The user tells Raindrop's front-end to unsubscribe from a mailing list.
#   Raindrop's front-end sends an unsubscription request to the mailing list.
#   Raindrop's front-end sets the mailing list status to "unsubscribe-pending".
#
# Step 2: List Requests Confirmation
#   The mailing list requests confirmation of the unsubscription request.
#   This extension responds with confirmation of the unsubscription request.
#   This extension sets the mailing list status to "unsubscribe-confirmed".
#
# Final State: User is Unsubscribed
#   The mailing list sends an unsubscription notification to the user.
#   This extension sets the mailing list status to "unsubscribed".

# TODO: split this extension into two extensions: one that creates/updates
# mailing list documents and handles unsubscription messages; and another that
# simply associates messages with their lists.  That will improve performance,
# because the latter task performs no queries so can be batched.
